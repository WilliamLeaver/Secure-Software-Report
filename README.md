# Secure-Software-Report
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
- Artemis financial is a company that handles individualized financial plans. They were looking to modernize their security. Specifically they were looking to add a file verification step. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
- When a security vulnerability is found taking responsibility for it and jumping in to fix it is how I handled the security flaws I found. It is important to code securely because it can keep you from doing extra work.
- By keeping security top of mind you can also ensure that your company does have larger overhead in repair security issues and in some cases it can help avoid lawsuits. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- I had a lot of trouble with getting the self signed certificate to work, but once it was set it was cool to see my own certificate show up on the website. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- I increased layer of security by working with a checksum and adding https. Using a vulnerability chart and following it was a great way to decide what type of security will be relevant for your project. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- I ensured the code was function via a j-unit test. To ensure I did not add new vulnerability's I looked over the code and made sure to you good coding practices. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- Learning to use the dependency check was a great skill, and also learning to implement https for websites. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- I think that employers can see my more technical skills in this project.
